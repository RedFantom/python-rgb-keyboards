# Python RGB Keyboards Library
[![GPL License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0)

This is a project that aims to create a universal RGB keyboard control 
library in Python. Using the varous SDKs available and by creating 
wrappers around them, this library allows you to control the RGB k
eyboards of multiple brands in a universal manner with the same function 
structure and arguments passed.

## Keyboards
Please check the `BACKENDS.md` file for more information on what 
keyboards are supported by the various included back-ends in this
library. Most back-ends have additional dependencies that might
not be free software on depend on non-free software.

## Goals
The goal of this project is to provide a universal interface for all RGB 
Keyboards for Python programmers with a consistent function structure. 
I would like to include as many keyboards in the library as possible, 
but I can only test the code for the Cooler MasterKeys SDK. If you 
experience any issues, please report them in the issues section. Also,
