# SDKs
Currently, the SDKs of the keyboards of Corsair, Cooler Master and 
Logitech are only available under proprietary software licenses. 
Therefore you must download all the SDKs yourself and you are not 
allowed to share your software because the license granted to you by the 
manufacturer is non-transferable!

You can check out the SDKs in this list:

- [Cooler Master SDK](http://makerhub.coolermaster.com/custom-lighting/assets/sdk/coolermaster-sdk.zip)
- [Corsair CUE SDK](http://forum.corsair.com/v3/attachment.php?attachmentid=24542&d=1457043299)
- [Logitech SDK](http://gaming.logitech.com/sdk/LED_8.87.zip)

Then copy the respective DLL-files to the folder `sdks` in this folder 
with the following names:

- `Logitech64.dll` and `Logitech.dll`
- `CoolerMaster64.dll` and `CoolerMaster.dll`
- `Corsair64.dll` and `Corsair.dll`

Note that these tasks can also be automatically performed using the 
`download.py` file.
